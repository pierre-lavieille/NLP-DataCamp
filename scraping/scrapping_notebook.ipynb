There are enormous dahlias on the wallpaper which are stunning. The staff is very nice and very attentive. But 70 Euros for sole and spinach is high. It was tasty but not the most delicious fish I've ever eaten by a long stretch. My husband said he's had better veal chops in many restaurants in the US. Both his veal and my fish were salty for our palates. The artichoke soup and the asparagas salad were both very tasty and beautiful to look at. The bread is very good. The butter is very good. But they did not give us an amuse bouche which we had anticipated based on other reviews on this site. When we inquired, we were told that the cheese twist that had come with the bread was the amuse bouche. We saw a couple seated near us served beautiful looking amuse bouches so we're not sure who gets them and who doesn't. We spent 90 Euros on a lovely bottle of wine and each ordered an appetizer and an entree so it wasn't as if we were trying to get off cheap. The cheeseburger and fries looked delicious. Maybe that's the way to go. Or the 52 Euro lunch may seem like a better value than our dinner for 317 Euros without a tip. In fairness, we did not order dessert. Those we saw also looked amazing. We were given a plate of candies with the check and they were heavenly.\", 'Grade': '5', 'Username': '37SusieB', 'Price': ' ', 'Style': []})\n",

The hotel that the restaurant is in is one of the top hotels in Paris and walking in you can absolutely tell. The restaurant iis the less expensive ones in the hotel, but it is still very expensive and the best way to enjoy it is to know that going in. The restaurant itself is beautiful, not overly fancy but perfectly decorated and sophisticated. The wait staff in general were excellent. Our waiter was so warm and friendly I almost invited him to stay with us when he comes to NY later in the summer. He was extremely attentive and helpful but not overbearing. We have seen a lot of reviews that talk about how cold or in attentive the waitstaff is but our experience was the total opposite. As for the food, it was all excellent. I had the sea bream tartare, something I have never had and really enjoyed it. My daughter got the gazpacho, which was excellent. For main courses, she had the cod and I had the lamb, both of which were excellent. Finally, for dessert, she had the profiteroles with coconut ice cream and I had the chocolate souffle tart. Minasked to replace the cherry sorbet with another kind and they happily did so. We had champagnevtobstart and then a glass of wine. They brought us a taste and the waiter could tell we didn't love it so without hesitation he asked if he could bring us another wine to try that we loved. Overall, the evening was very special and we thoroughly enjoyed it.

For starters, its in the gorgeous and elegant Hotel Bristol. Be sure to visit the garden courtyard and also the Bristol Bar.114 Fauborg is an interesting blend of classic elegance and a more fresh, contemporary style. The service was friendly and polite but not stuffy. We arrived at 8:00 p.m. and the restaurant was about half full. By 9:00 p.m., the restaurant was full, and it was a very fashionable crowd.The duck pate is truly to die for, and was the most classical of the dishes we sampled.. Very rich---I really didn't need an entree, but I had one anyway.The king crab appetizer was also good----quite light, and perhaps not as memorable as the pate.All dishes were presented beautifully, and (apart from the duck pate), were fairly light and fresh. Desserts were a standout. I really didn't want the evening to end.

The menu is classic American with loads of extras and large portions which considering the price was very fair :) most impressive was the variety of beers! Service was excellent and welcoming, offering recommendations which cater for your taste when unsure.

The waitress was very attentive as well. The price lean towards the expensive side, but as many reviews suggest, you get what you pay for.

We were there for breakfast so we took a quick look at the menu and had a hard time making up our mind because all the food sounded delightful. I got their American style pancakes with fruit and my wife got bacon eggs and toast. I was not only, not disappointed but rather was blown away by how good the pancakes were. Between the fluffiness of the cake itself and the sweet/tartness of the syrup and fresh fruit, I found myself contemplating a second order. The pricing I felt was very fair given the average rate of food in Paris, and the service was beyond great. Our waiter was Jeff and he was very personable and made our experience not only enjoyable, but very memorable. He encouraged us to come back later for a drink, and so we did. Once again we were blown away by the staff at the restaurant as well as the food. We had shots for drinks, and then got osme cheese cake, both were phenomenal.

We ordered various burgers for the adults and a club sandwich. The food came out without too much of a wait with the club sandwich following about 5 minutes later. It was average. Things went sharply downhill from then on. The children were waiting for their desserts and getting fed up. All the staff had disappeared so we could not ask. Eventually I went up to the bar where there were two staff and asked for the desserts. They said they would go and see. About twenty minutes later they arrived. This was too long. We were all fed up so we asked for the bill straight away when they brought the puds. There were still no staff about. The staff we did deal with were very polite and friendly but service was just too slow. Also the toilets smelled of urine.

One of the waiters paired the veal with a lovely dry white wine too.

I had the spinach and ricotta ravioli while my wife had the tortellini for mains. We had a lovely bottle of prosecco to go with our food and finished with a tiramisu.

You have to be patient though, cause this nice gesture takes it's time. We had Antipasti Misto, Tigelle, Tortelli Reggiani, Tortelloni 3 fromagi, Crostata Creme Citron and Tiramisu.

The decor is trendy, the staff very efficient and friendly (with good English if you don’t speak French) and the food is of a very high quality. The menu is not extensive, which I think is a good thing, and there is usually a couple of specials. We turned up on a Tuesday evening and it was full so I would recommend booking in advance, as it’s not a big place. We booked for the next evening and were so impressed we booked again for the following evening. The wine list is a bit pricey but the dishes are good value: about €20 for a main course and €9/€10 for starters and desserts. Bon appetit.

I checked nearby Italian restaurants and found Via Emilia. It was a delight. The waiter was accommodating even though we had no reservation. The starter plates were generous and tasty. My companion had a plate of aged ham and cheese and I opted for grilled vegetables. Both were delicious and satisfying. My ravioli was the day’s choice and not listed on the menu. It was nicely seasoned and flavorful. My companion had the lasagna. We finished with a strawberry cheesecake that was perfectly elegant and a delight! We also opted for a bottle of the lowest priced wine on the menu, skipping the ritual of the second lowest. Our waiter declared that a smart choice and we agreed. The service was prompt and we were explained our choices in English even though the menu was on a chalkboard in French only.

The starters were good but then came the main course. I had asked for a steak that was medium rare , as had the man at the next table. His steak arrived and indeed it was medium rare but then mine came and it was very over done and more like medium to well done - barely any pink left at all. I brought this to the waiters attention and he told me that the man next to me was not having his steak the same as mine however the owner, when taking his order, had even tut tutted at the fact that he wanted his steak medium rare and not rare. The waiter then went to get the owner who really did not appear to appreciate my complaint and made some excuses as to why it was over cooked. He did offer to get another one but he appeared reluctant in his offer to do this and by this time my partner was half way through his meal so I declined. When it came to payment there was nothing taken off the bill and no apologies. The place looked nice, the food was well presented but when the food you get is not what you ordered the rest is insignificant.

I had been to JAPAN many times over the past two years and was intrigued by chef Uchiyama-san‘s promise of Japanese-French fusion cuisine. We walked by the restaurant in the afternoon to book a table (recommended, as it is a small place) and were really excited to see all the preparations going on. Our table for two at 8pm kept all the promises. No extravaganza on the furniture and interior decor, but a very warm and welcoming atmosphere. We had the full menu with one sake- and one wine combination accompanying the dishes. And a bottle of still water to add some neutral liquid. Both choices of alcohol were excellent, but I would recommend the sake, as it adds it the extra-ordinary to the delicious food. And the mellowness of the three sakes is just amazing. All dishes were beautifully styled and opened a true spectrum of extraordinary tastes. I can‘t really pick a favorite as they all stood for themselves. I really got a kick out of the tofu first dish and the panna cotta with coco-milk. We had a second round of the entrecôte main dish - not because the potion was too small but because the taste was so addicting. The service was perfect and while we did not need it they were able to speak some English. Chef Uchiyama-san took the for a little chat at the end and this is definitely not the last time we have been here. For the high quality of food and drinks, the pricing is absolutely adequate (If you look for large choices in the menu, vegan or salads - this may not be the right stop for you).

The level of finesse was through the roof. The service was very professional but friendly at the same time. The waiter really took time to explain everything and he had a lot of knowledge.

We booked a table at Boutary for the last night of our trip. Fantastic, attentive, English-friendly service. We selected the five course tasting menu and the standard wine pair, along with the beluga caviar and champagne to start. Recommend the caviar to all those who haven't had it. Was an experience, and the staff explained it all to us very well. Food was excellent overall. First plate was an unbelievable roast fig with blue cheese and a nut topping. Out of this world. Second plate was a smoked potato mousse with caviar and a cheese cracker. Really good; caviar very different from the beluga starter. Third plate was monkfish tail. Not a huge fan of monkfish, but it was done about as well as it could have been. Fourth plate was a chicken dish. Last dish was a dense chocolate cake. Also great. While the food was very good, it was the service and the feel that made it special.

A cheerful welcome was already a good sign . They seated us upstairs where we appreciated the decor all done around black red and white with an interesting illumination. The menu offers different choices from a degustation menu that involves also different wines from menu a la carte . We decided for a la carte and a bottle of Sancerre 2016 . But first We could not renounce to the temptation of tasting some beluga caviar which was excellent . The wine was excellent although it never reached the perfect temperature . My first course was bonito in tataki sauce which was delicious except for the chipped dish in which it was served . As a main course I choose a turbot with artichokes cooked in 3 ways, clams and a symphony of tastes that were exquisite . We were extremely pleased also with the perfect service and by meeting the creative chef .A place worth to return .

A wet towel should have been presented so you can clean your hand and remove perfume of handcream. An appetizer and two starters came very quick one after another, so we had to ask for a pause. The smoked mashed potatoes with siberian caviar was nice. Mains were a very good monkfish with oriental inspiration and a good black angus with asparagus. We went for the strawberries dessert, which was a delight. Nice winelist, correct prices.\", 'Grade': '5', 'Username': 'michel l', 'Price': ' US$61 - US$145 ', 'Style': []})\n",

I dare say it was even better the second time around. Both times we ordered the tasting menu with wine pairings. Since the menu continually changes, I will come here every time I'm in Paris. The dishes were light and refreshing. The only course that was the same from March 2018 was the caviar, and I was thrilled that it did not differ. The sous vide potatoes are such an amazing complement to the caviar. The soup course was like nothing I'd ever tasted, sort of a pea gazpacho. For me, the monkfish was the highlight and I've never had quinoa that tasted so amazing. The dessert was absolutely amazing and the perfect ending to a stunning five course meal. The meal is an investment, but frankly is a bargain for the quality of food and wine that you are served.\", 'Grade': '5', 'Username': 'JHRedSox', 'Price': ' US$61 - US$145 ', 'Style': []})\n",

But I had not developed appreciation for French cuisine after many years of trying. When I had a chance to visit France in 2017, I was determined to try various well known local restaurants recommended by TripAdvisor.com and other rating agencies. Boutary was one of the restaurants that we visited and tried some recommended dishes by previous patrons. My wife and I became a fan of Boutary not just for the excellent food but also because of an on-site caviar specialist by the name of Frederic. He was knowledgeable, kind, likable,and patient in every way and made our dinging experience exceptionally entertaining. He took time to answer all questions from me and my wife with a warm smile. His unsophisticated manner also made us feel welcome and important throughout the dinner. My wife and I went back to Boutary after 2 years in March 2019. To my amazement, Frederic greeted us by our name and even remembered the table at which we sat the previous time. Feeling at home immediately, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and caviar the second time around. Because of Boutary, my wife and I started appreciating French cuisine and venturing into other French restaurants in the US. Boutary is the favorite spot for me and my wife. I also recommend it to all my family and friends.', 'Grade': '5', 'Username': 'Kee K', 'Price': ' US$61 - US$145 ', 'Style': []})\n",

We're on a tight budget. I got some chicken and my friend got some lamb, as they were some of the cheapest options. The owner casually asked us if we wanted some rice, as if it was already counted in the original dish. We both got different kinds of rice. The food itself was alright, but nothing fantastic. The big problem was when we had to pay. I thought I was going to pay 12 €, but I learned that the rice was not part of the original dish. Instead of 12 €, I pay 18 €, meaning the rice itself was 6 €. Same thing happened to my friend. We were not informed that the rice was a supplement. Also the owner asked us insistently if we wanted to have bread. Thank God we refused, otherwise the bill would have been far too high for us!\", 'Grade': '3', 'Username': 'sophiebN1627QB', 'Price': ' ', 'Style': []})\n",

Well, the food of course was great; the chef (we were told) had been the #2 at a well-known restaurant. We did the prix fixe menu with the wine pairing and the caviar tasting. The first two wine pairings in particular were interesting - a Riesling from Alsace and a white Burgundy paired well with the early courses and were really nice, even though neither of us typically drinks white.But as good as the food and wine were, what made Boutary so memorable was the service. It is difficult to deliver exceptional service that is at the same time friendly, funny, engaging, and informative. But the team that served us on Jan 1st did just that. A caviar expert for the caviar tasting, who taught us how the caviar was produced and how to best enjoy it (my first time); the sommelier who explained the wine pairings, the regions, how they were meant to complement each dish; the waiter who helped us understand what we were eating, and how it was prepared (painstakingly, it turns out - and with great skill!). It is difficult to be formal without being pretentious, while putting guests at ease. These gentlemen were really, really good at what they do.Thanks for a really special dinner, Boutary.

The entire experience was outstanding. This year we visited Paris a few weeks before our anniversary, but wanted to celebrate it again at Boutary. The Boutary team did not disappoint. When we arrived, we were amazed to find that they had remembered and saved for us the same table we ate at last year. Again, we ordered the chef's set dinner with the accompanying premium wines. The variety, artistry, and quality were excellent. What really sets Boutary apart is the atmosphere and reception. Frederic and his team create an elegant, yet completely friendly and approachable ambiance. It;s fun to be surprised with the chef's creations, with the notable exception of their signature appetizer, a divine concoction of smooth potato puree, caviar, and cream. Not to be missed! Every question is answered eagerly without a hint of stuffiness or condescension. While we were there, an individual woman without a reservation dropped in to see if there was any availability. As it happened, there was one small table available. She was treated with the same kindness and respect given to larger parties with advanced reservations (which we heartily recommend, and can be done easily through Trip Advisor).

This is among the very best. The menu is short because every dish is so complex and amazing. The dishes are as much “ composed” as they are cooked, and from the very best ingredients. You don’t have to like caviar ( an emphasis ) to eat here but maybe you should indulge and try it. I had pork which itself was complex and delicious but as an example the accompanying potato was made by shredding the raw potato in long sticks, blanching briefly, rinsing in cold water to stop the cooking and keep them firm, flash frying quickly, not browned just finished, with some mussels and I think a touch of a mild rice wine vinegar. That’s effort, that’s delicious, and that’s just for a small side. Service was the best at any restaurant this trip but knowledgeable friendly waiters who really help you enjoy your meal.

Very helpful in his recommendations and explanations, and he also gave us some information on the origins of the restaurant and Paris in general. We got vodka recommendations too! We did not try the tasting menu since we had done that at a few other restaurants and just wanted to choose what we wanted on this occasion. Everything was excellent. We had the John Dorey, crab salad, blue lobster, pork, and the chocolate and peach desserts. The hotel fully deserves its great reputation since everything was beautifully presented, really delicious, good sized portions and not pretentious and overpriced as we found in some other establishments. It was on a small street that I don’t think we would have found on our own if we had taken the metro. Luckily we opted for a taxi.

The textures were good on two of the five dishes, but missed the mark on three of the dishes. It was like the restaurant was under new ownership (I don't think this is the case). I heard the owner opened a new restaurant and was at the new restaurant during our meal. Makes sense to me since the dining experience we had tonight was shockingly poor.

The moment a site gets 3 stars in a green guide, you can be sure that it will be so flooded with tourists that you have to avoid it. The moment a restaurant gets one or more stars in the red guide, it stops serving food and starts serving gourmet food and hype. We had several meals at Michelin starred restaurants lately which left us deeply unsatisfied and full of doubt as to the future of the whole restaurant industry. so we were glad to try a restaurant in Paris which didn't have a Michelin star but was warmly recommended to us by friends. Happily we spent a satisfying evening at Boutary. The venue is intimate and pleasant. The service is friendly and efficient without becoming a nuisance. The food menu is very limited, but every dish was well prepared, tasty, of decent size, and without being overburdened by a host of superfluous and contrasting ingredients. The wine list is rather limited, but we managed to find a wine that pleased us and so would you. After all, do we really need a 300 pages wine list when all we want is a single bottle of good wine, Our only complaint was regarding the tasting of the caviar of the day which left us feeling a bit made fun of. Apart from that, we had a very enjoyable evening.\", 'Grade': '5', 'Username': 'Toni13', 'Price': ' US$61 - US$145 ', 'Style': []})\n",

On it's own, Boutary is a fabulous establishment: many walk-ins were turned away because of the number of pre-bookings and I heard French, British English, Japanese and Americans all around me. I was pleasantly surprised when wait staff spoke Japanese, adding a warmth to the dining experience that was uncalled for but thoroughly enjoyed. Getting back to how reviews change restaurants... Dining that evening were other Americans and they made it abundantly clear they were unhappy with the toughness of the meat. I think they ruined their own meal all by themselves actually. I felt embarrassed both being American but also for the staff and chef. Nevertheless, it's about expectations: we were warned before hand that Americans tend to expect really tender, melt-in-your mouth meat at fine dining restaurants and it was explained that the beef, while considered some of the best in the world, was rugged and required chewing. With that in mind, my party was able to enjoy the experience immensely. The Americans on the other hand, asked for their meals to be taken back. Overall, I felt like apologizing to Boutary. You are on the right path. We could clearly taste the passion and careful thought in each bite.

As far as we’re concerned, it could have been # 1. It’s a smaller understated restaurant in an old charming building with painted wooden beams in the ceiling etc. We chose the 5 course degustation (€85) with optional superior wine pairing (€29, but cheaper options were available), rather than the interesting à la carte menu. We also selected the option of Beluga caviar for an additional €19, which was an excellent experience in itself. We eat in restaurants often, including fine dining, but this was equal to the best we’ve ever experienced. Each course was exquisite, both in taste and texture, the ambience was delightful, and the service excellent.

Very subtle flavors, and so many of them, with some connections from one course to the next, We also had excellent champagne and a very good bottle of chablis. Superb service as well. We were there from 20h to midnight, never rushed, always savoring something unusual and supremely delicious and our glasses never empty. The young chef came out at the end, really talented, Rush to have this experience before he moves up and charges 3 times more, and has investors he has to cater to. The decor is fine, there was adequate air-conditioning on this unseasonably hot period. Quiet for long conversations. Most memorable, and one of the best meals I've had in Paris in decades of ilving here.

The service was outstanding, and the children were treated exceedingly well. My husband and I wanted the tasting menu, but they prefer that everyone at the table get the prix fixe menu. Since two of our diners were children, we weren't sure how that would go. They recommended that the kids share a tasting menu, which was PERFECT. Price-wise, it was similar to if they both ordered an entree off of the a la carte menu, and they were able to try everything. Our menu consisted of a smoked meat starter (kids liked), caviar and potato appetizer (one child LOVED and the other child wouldn't try, parents LOVED), fish entree (kids didn't love, parents did), steak entree (everyone could not get enough) and two different desserts that were amazing. The adults also did the wine pairing, which is recommended as all of the wines were amazing. Not inexpensive, but well worth it if you plan to do one nice meal while in Paris.

I had asked in advance for a cozy spot conducive to quiet conversation with my slightly challenged hearing and we were escorted to one of the two tables in the red niche (see the gallery on their website). The decor in rest of the place is a joy behold (there are no 'bad' seats here) but this was the right choice for us that night and we were thankful for the thought that went into it. Our prix fixe menu was great from start to finish. The caviar, for which the place is justly famous, was wonderfully served in a small bowl atop a tower of potatoes that had been smoked over an aromatic wood, all surrounded by an exquisite dollop of cream sauce--it was just tremendous! Other dishes, though, from fresh fish to delicious foie gras, were prepared with equal creativity and perfectly done. Our desserts were both light and flavorful. Our very knowledgeable servers, Miguel and Angel, guided us through the menu and accompanying wine choices expertly with contagious good humor. Fine dining too often lacks the element of fun in favor of high seriousness. For us that night, Boutary was a pleasant departure from that rule. The dining was indeed fine and fun! There are so many good choices to eat in Paris, even within the St. Germain area alone, but I'll pay Boutary the highest compliment I can think of in such a competitive dining environment--we'll be back!\", 'Grade': '5', 'Username': 'jgreen2016', 'Price': ' US$61 - US$145 ', 'Style': []})\n",

I am so hooked on trying new foods! My husband and I experienced an INCREDIBLE restaurant in Paris! The owner of the restaurant has a caviar farm in Bulgaria and shared his vision for his restaurant(s). We told the owner and server to bring us the “chef’s inspirations”. We started with our first lesson on caviar paired with champagne. Totally changed my whole perception of caviar! Smooth, creamy, buttery, mild. Then on to the next taste- thinly sliced celery carpaccio, green apples infused with hibiscus (oh what heaven) as well as thin sticks of green apple and thin sliced smoked beef with sea urchin. What a marriage of tastes and texture! Next? A serving of potato’s with a more mature caviar and lemongrass crème. While the tastes exploded with each new plate, I wondered how the next one could change my world. Next? Norwegian lobster served with a bisque and lobster sauce, softened beets, and lightly seared fois gras. So melt in your mouth! More? Of course! Aged beef with horseradish/crème/ and lime sauce , parsnip purée, lightly steamed spinach with garlic. Fantastic! On to dessert- a mandarine cream with mandarine pulp, a nutty crumbly base, crowned with melted then hardened transparent sugar. Wow! Dessert two? Pistachio crumble topped with a light citrus meranguine and white chocolate discs, small clusters of pink grapefruit pulp and a raspberry sorbet. Upon the completion of the meal, the owner offered us a small digestif. We again deferred to his knowledge. For My husband, he brought a smoked vodka and for me, rhubarb vodka. Again Wow!!!! We look forward to going back at least 4 or 5 more times before the end of summer!

We were cosseted from the moment of arrival by the wonderfully attentive staff. Opting for the tasting menu, together with a caviar tasting, and the staffs' choice of wines was an excellent choice. My partner had never tasted caviar and was very nervous but we were both blown away by the exquisite buttery taste which was not at all fishy. This was just the start of a taste journey which went from one sublime dish to another. The matched wines were equally divine. Yes, this is not the sort of meal we can afford on a regular basis; but as a very very special treat it was well worth every penny, and we floated away afterwards on feet of air.

The food is stylish and clever but not overly so. there is no pretension here but there is real emphasis on style without compromising or overcomplicating taste.

What a great choice! Very adventurous menu, with interesting choices. We went with the fixed menu- great choice. We had two appetizers- crab in kohlrabi ravioli with cucumber jelly, followed by potatoes in lemon cream with caviar. What a great marriage of flavours! Our mains were sea bass with vegetables and beef paired with an amazing cherry purée. Dessert was equally decadent, and all was accompanied by a lovely wine from their excellent wine list. Highly recommend for a special evening or if you just want to indulge yourself. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

This time, close to depart to our country, Peru; we felt that we needed to try something else. We have seen a nearby restaurant, Mayfair Garden 16ieme, full of locals and foreigners. Today, we tried three different dishes and rice. All were of excellent quality, with good ingredients and nicely served (picture included). We ordered two that we’ve tried in Washington DC and other cities, famous for their good Indian cuisine. We were gladly surprised by the comparable flavors and quality of the dishes. Even more, the ratio of price/quality makes this restaurant a good choice for family dinners. And above all, we felt from the moment we entered the restaurant, the excellent service we’ve experienced in other more famous restaurants than the Mayfair Garden 16ieme, but that at some point were also less known. I don’t doubt that soon this restaurant will be considered a good option for those who like Indian food in Paris. In addition, since it is also close to tourist areas, like the Arc de Triomphe, it is worth a visit and a good opportunity to try something new.', 'Grade': '5', 'Username': 'sofiav858', 'Price': ' US$36 - US$73 ', 'Style': []})\n",

All the dishes were very beautifully done and tasted amazing. I highly recommend this place for dinner. I took off one star for service as it was very very slow. It took ages to take our order and then to ask us about each course. Meanwhile the table next to us was served much quicker than us.
